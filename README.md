# AE4S07_Project_25b
Code for Micropropulsion project #25b

This repository contains all of the Matlab scripts and functions that were used for project #25b.

"experimental.m" generates figures of the experimental data, the linear approximations, and the power efficiencies of the three thrusters.

"Ld1.m" generates the figure showing the maximum and minimum possible slopes for the power/pressure curve of Ld1.

"heatLossFigure.m" generates the plots of the heat losses of each thruster.

"operationResults.m" shows the results of the simulations.

The scripts "chamber_pressure.m" and "ideal_power.m" were taken from Gelmi's report.
