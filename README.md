# AE4S07_Project_25b
Code for Micropropulsion project #25b

This repository contains all of the Matlab scripts and functions that were used for project #25b.

- `experimental.m` generates figures of the experimental data, the linear approximations, and the power efficiencies of the three thrusters.

- `slopesLd1.m` generates the figure showing the maximum and minimum possible slopes for the power/pressure curve of Ld1.

- `heatLossFigure.m` generates the plots of the heat losses of each thruster.

- `TvapBS2.m` generates the plot of the vaporization temperature of thruster BS2 in ambient and vacuum conditions.

- `operationResults.m` shows the results of the simulations.

- The directory `thermalModel` contains the Solidworks files of the VLM thermal model (parts, assembly and drawing).

- The scripts `chamber_pressure.m` and `ideal_power.m` were taken from Gelmi's report.
